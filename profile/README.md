# Become part of the community

Since 2021 we have been developing a community of likeminded individuals, who we meet weekly for:

- Project Demonstrations and Deep Dives
- Mini-lectures on computational topics, eg.: Caustics
- Paper Reviews on new, exciting papers.

If you would like to apply to the community then DM us on @hellosemy or @itchingpixels to join the family.
