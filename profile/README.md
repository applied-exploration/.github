**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Welcome 👋
We are an independent Machine Learning Research and Development Studio based in Berlin.

We aspire to:
* Work with experts to develop useful tools and solutions to real-world problems
* Create interpretable ML to expand human knowledge
* Explore if ML practices hold up to scrutiny and revitalize forgotten ideas in AI
* Make state of the art algorithms more convenient to access

# Become part of the community

Since 2021 we have been developing a community of likeminded individuals, who we meet weekly for:

- Project Demonstrations and Deep Dives
- Mini-lectures on computational topics, eg.: Caustics
- Paper Reviews on new, exciting papers.

If you would like to apply to the community then DM us on @hellosemy or @itchingpixels to join the family.


# Subscribe to our progress

Become part of the journey in experimenting with a new way of organising technological spin-offs.
We write deep insights into what went well and wrong in our projects, and show the state of affairs in those segments.
